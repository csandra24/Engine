# Super Effort Engine

This engine is the result of a lot of effort and dedication for the master in ADVANCED PROGRAMMING FOR AAA VIDEO GAMES.

As a person who does not come from a technical background, it has been a **CHALLENGE**, that's why I decided to name the Engine the **"Super Effort Engine"**, maybe is not perfect but I am very happy with the final result and despite the silly mistakes I had a great time creating it.
